# Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

# Example

# For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
# almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = false;

# There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

# For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
# almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = true.

# You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].
